A repo to practise the Functional programming in Scala exercises.

The aim is to meet weekly and discuss and mob programme on a chapter.
Each week, you should have attempted atleast a few of the exercises in the chapter.

Please fork this repository and use this repo to write your solutions to the exercises keeping the same project structure as the main repo.

- ~~Mobbed on the fibonacci sequence in TDD style.~~

### Week 2 - 28/02/20:
- ~~Go through, read and complete exercises in Chapter 2 (HOFs).~~
- ~~In the next meet-up we will go through ones we found difficult and compare solutions.~~
- ~~And then Mob on either a difficult chapter 2 exercise or try a chapter 3 one.~~
- Plus we did and discussed exercises 1 and 2.

### Week 3 - 04/03/20:
- Go through, read and complete exercises in Chapter 3 (Data Structures).
